\title{Adding a trend to survival rates in different stages}
\usage{
insert_trend_trunc(surv_rand, beta, nstage, stage2mod, years, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{dictates how large the trend is to be introduced to survival matrices. A value of -beta will be added to survival each year}

\item{nstage}{is the number of stages represented in the matrix data}

\item{stage2mod}{the index of the stage for which survival is to be modified}

\item{years}{number of years in the simulation}

\item{surv_mat}{an array of randomized survival matrices}
}
\value{
surv_trend An array of matrices with a trend in survival

surv_zero a count of the number of times survival goes to zero after a trend is inserted
}
\description{
This function adds a trend to stage 2 survival
in the survival matrices for a stage or age structured population.
